# Simple File Explorer in Python

## Overview

This Python script creates a basic file explorer using the `os` and `tkinter` libraries. The script allows users to navigate through directories, view files, and open them using the default system application. Explore this script to understand the fundamentals of creating a simple file explorer in Python.

## Script Components

- **Library Usage:** Utilizing the `os` and `tkinter` libraries for directory navigation and GUI creation.
- **File Listing:** Displaying a list of files and directories in the selected path.
- **Directory Navigation:** Allowing users to navigate through directories and view files.
- **File Opening:** Enabling the opening of selected files using the default system application.
- **GUI Design:** Creating a basic graphical user interface (GUI) for the file explorer.
- **Output Display:** Displaying messages and notifications to the user.

## Running the Script

1. Open and run the Python script (`file_explorer.py`) in a Python environment.
2. The script will launch a basic file explorer GUI.
3. Navigate through directories, view files, and open them using the default system application.

## Customization

- Modify the script to include additional features, such as file deletion or copying.
- Experiment with different GUI designs or add file details in the listing.
- Adapt the code to handle specific file types differently.
